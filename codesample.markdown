You can find a sample of code I authored by clicking on the link below. 

I produced this code in 2018 for an AWS corporate client in financial services. 

This archive contains a source code implementing an RL agent on AWS SageMaker to audit financial claims written in natural language. The agent's goal is to identify fraudulent claims. The agent learns from two sources of feedback: <br/> 
1) Feedback produced for every item by a *reward model* pre-trained by supervised learning to identify compliance levels <br/> 
2) Human feedback on custom patterns of frauds (sparse but considered ground truth) <br/>

A README file is included.
