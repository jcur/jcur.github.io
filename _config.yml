# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

  This will be a short but awesome description for my new site here. I can edit this
  line in _config.yml. It will appear in my document head meta (for
  Google search results) and in my feed.xml site description.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
