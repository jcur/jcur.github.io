<span style="font-size:20px">***Welcome to my personal website!***</span> 

I'm a Research Scientist at Amazon Web Services (AWS) and an Adjunct Faculty at New York University (NYU). On this website you can find a list of my publications and some teaching material. 

I'm fascinated by teamwork, mathematics, computers, psychology, biology, and the *interfaces* between these topics. I'm sure you are too. Can we apply mathematical ideas to help a team better work together? Or are we doing it already? Can we, will we, and should we, develop computer systems to emulate biological ones? How about smarter ones? To try and contribute, I acquired hands-on expertise in dynamic systems, time series simulations, reinforcement learning, and large language models.<br/> 

At AWS, I implement and fine tune large language models, and other generative AI solutions, for AWS corporate customers. From 2021 to 2023, I was a Research Science Manager where I led a team of six scientists and developed the first Reinforcement Learning prototype for workforce planning at Amazon!
And before that I was part of AWS AI global specialty practice where I built ML solutions for AWS corporate customers. Since 2022 I have also been teaching two graduate courses at New York University, *Programming for Data Science* and *Reinforcement Learning*.
