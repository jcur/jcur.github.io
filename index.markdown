***Welcome to my personal website!*** 

I'm a Research Scientist and a Professor, so on this website you can find a list of my publications and some teaching material. 

I'm interested in teamwork, mathematics, computers, psychology, and biology. And acting and singing. I know what you're thinking: who isn't? :) So a long time ago I decided to become fascinated (yes, it worked) by the *interfaces* between these topics. For example, can we apply mathematical concepts to help a team better work together? What does that has to do with Multi-Agent RL? (answer: everything). And of course, can we, will we, should we, develop computer systems just as awesome as biological ones? How about smarter ones? To try and contribute, I acquired hands-on expertise in dynamic systems, time series simulations, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing.<br/> 

At Amazon, I manage a science team to help Amazon optimize its talent workforce. At AWS I was part of the Global AI Specialty Practice where I helped customers solve business problems with machine learning. I currently teach two courses at New York University: *Programming for Data Science*, and *Reinforcement Learning*.
