<span style="font-size:20px">***Welcome to my personal website!***</span> 

I'm a Research Scientist Manager at Amazon and a Professor at NYU. On this website you can find a list of my publications and some teaching material. 

I'm fascinated by teamwork, mathematics, computers, psychology, biology, and the *interfaces* between these topics. I'm sure you are too. Can we apply mathematical ideas to help a team better work together? Or are we doing it already? Can we, will we, and should we, develop computer systems to emulate biological ones? How about smarter ones? To try and contribute, I acquired hands-on expertise in dynamic systems, time series simulations, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing.<br/> 

At Amazon, I lead a science team to help optimize something called *talent planning*, and in particular we are implementing Generative AI solutions to help better manager the Amazon workforce. Before that I was part of AWS AI GSP (global specialty practice) where I built ML solutions for Amazon corporate customers. I also teach two graduate courses at New York University, *Programming for Data Science* and *Reinforcement Learning*.
