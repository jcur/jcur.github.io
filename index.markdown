***Welcome to my personal website!*** 

I'm a Research Scientist and a Professor, so on this website you can find a list of my publications and some teaching material. 

I'm fascinated by teamwork, mathematics, computers, psychology, biology, and the *interfaces* between these topics. I'm sure you are too. Can we apply mathematical ideas to help a team better work together? Or are we doing it already? What does that has to do with Multi-Agent RL? And of course, can we, will we, should we, develop computer systems to emulate biological ones? How about smarter ones? To try and contribute, I acquired hands-on expertise in dynamic systems, time series simulations, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing.<br/> 

At Amazon, I lead a science team to help optimize something called *talent planning*, and before that at AWS I was part of the global AI specialty practice where I built ML solutions for corporate customers. I also teach two courses at New York University, *Programming* and *Reinforcement Learning*.
